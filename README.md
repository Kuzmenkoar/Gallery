You have to install mongodb and npm for this project.

After installing this programs folow the instruction:

1) Install modules with command "npm install".

2) Run mongod server on port 27017(standart port) with path to our database (folder database).
I used command "mongod --dbpath /home/kuzmenkoar/Desktop/Project/gallery/database".
Also u can change path in package.json and run this code with command "npm data".

3) Run Node server with command "npm start". If somsing is wrong u can run it with command "node server.js".

4) Run application http://localhost:3000/ in browser.
